        <p>
          Chess is a board game for two players. The goal of the game is to
          checkmate the opponent's king.
        </p>
        <h2>The Board</h2>
        <p>
          The chess board is a 64-square grid, with 8 squares on each side. The
          squares are alternately colored white and black.
        </p>
        <h2>The Pieces</h2>
        <p>There are 16 pieces in each chess set:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="pawn">
            <div class="wrapper">
              <div class="image">
                <img src="pawn.jpg" />
                <div class="ruleContent">
                  <h1>8 Pawns</h1>
                  <p>
                    The pawns are the weakest pieces, but they can also be very
                    powerful when used correctly.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="rook">
            <div class="wrapper">
              <div class="image">
                <img src="rook.jpg" />
                <div class="ruleContent">
                  <h1>2 Rooks</h1>
                  <p>
                    The rooks are the strongest pieces, and they can move any
                    number of squares in a straight line.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="knight">
            <div class="wrapper">
              <div class="image">
                <img src="knight.jpg" />
                <div class="ruleContent">
                  <h1>2 Knights</h1>
                  <p>
                    The knights are the most versatile pieces, and they can move
                    in an L-shape.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="bishop">
            <div class="wrapper">
              <div class="image">
                <img src="bishop.jpg" />
                <div class="ruleContent">
                  <h1>2 Bishops</h1>
                  <p>The bishops can move any number of squares diagonally.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="queen">
            <div class="wrapper">
              <div class="image">
                <img src="queen.jpg" />
                <div class="ruleContent">
                  <h1>1 Queen</h1>
                  <p>
                    The queen is the most powerful piece, and she can move any
                    number of squares in any direction.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="king">
            <div class="wrapper">
              <div class="image">
                <img src="king.jpg" />
                <div class="ruleContent">
                  <h1>1 King</h1>
                  <p>
                    The king is the most important piece, and he must be
                    protected at all costs.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>The Rules</h2>
        <p>
          The rules of chess are complex, but here are some of the basic rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>Each player takes turns moving one piece at a time.</p>
          <p>
            A piece can capture an enemy piece by moving to the square that the
            enemy piece is occupying.
          </p>
          <p>
            A piece cannot move to a square that is occupied by an friendly
            piece.
          </p>
          <p>A piece cannot move through an occupied square.</p>
          <p>The king cannot be captured.</p>
          <p>
            If the king is in check, the player must move the king out of check
            or capture the piece that is checking the king.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the king cannot be moved out of check, the player is checkmated
            and the game is over.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          These are just some of the basic rules of chess. For more information,
          please consult a chess book or website.
